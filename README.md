# USRSE Logos

This is a repository of logos, presentation templates, and other associated
branding files for the USRSE oranization.

Current logo files (new logo as of September 2021) are in `current_logo/`.  These are based on the original files in `99-design-logo/`.  

Other folders contain older logo files that are being kept in the repo for now to prevent links from breaking until transition to new logo is complete.  They should eventually be removed.  Do not use logos in directories other than `current_logo/` for new things.

If you would like a resource (different version of the logo, file type export, etc.) or have a question, please [open an issue](https://www.github.com/usrse/logo).  If you want a version of the logo in `99-design-logo/` that isn't in `current_logo/` - open an issue and we can make one with the correct colors.


The pink in the logos is #741755.  The light gray is #b0b5b7.

Closest pantone color (for printing) is 7650 C
