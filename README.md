# USRSE Logos

This is a repository of logos, presentation templates, and other associated
branding files for the US-RSE organization.  It is not for other graphics: only items with the US-RSE logo.  

Current logo files (new logo as of September 2021) are in `current_logo/`.  Do not use logos in directories other than `current_logo/` for new things.

If you would like a resource (different version of the logo, file type export, etc.) or have a question, please [open an issue](https://www.github.com/usrse/logo).  

The pink in the logos is #741755.  The light gray is #b0b5b7.

Closest pantone color (for printing) is 7650 C.
